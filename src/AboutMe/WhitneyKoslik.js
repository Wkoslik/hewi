            <h3>Whitney</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer, a rock climber, and a home-brewer who sees the many possibilities from taking a road less traveled. I provide stability for my team — domestic and international — with problem proof schedules and communication strategies. I give my team a sense of certainty with my open-minded considerations and initiatives to continue to learn. 
            </p>
